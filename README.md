# Photo Gallery

<p align="justify" > 
In this assignment, you are required to create a simple Android / iOS / Flutter / ReactNative app that displays a list of photos as a gallery. Users can tap the photo to see a full-screen view of it with the possibility to zoom in and out.
</p>

```
Requirements:
    1. Use Unsplash API Documentation | List of Photos to get a list of photos and build a gallery of photos
    2. The user can tap the photo and can see a full-screen view of the photo
    3. The user has an infinite scroll on the gallery screen

User Interface (UI)
    Part of this challenge is to design the UI for this app.
    You are free to create the UI as you see fit as long as the app meets the requirements.

Extra credits
    You are encouraged to extend this project and add features as you see fit.
    Our suggestion is that these extensions should add to, not subtract from, the user's experience.
    1. Unit tests
    2. The app’s flavor/scheme can be changed easily so that changing from development API
        to production API becomes trivial
    3. Cache images
    4. Cache API response
    5. Allow saving photos in JPEG format to the local gallery
    6. Allow sharing the photo
```
